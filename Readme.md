One Roll Engine is a Foundry VTT module, based on the [One-Roll Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Roll_Engine) (O.R.E) 
generic TTRPG system.  This basic system is used for games such as Wild Talents, Monsters and Other Childish Things, 
and The Velvet Book. 

#### [Changelog](https://github.com/itamarcu/one-roll-engine/blob/master/Changelog.md)

# Features

## Basic command: `/ore`
Use the `/ore` command to roll a number of dice (d10s, ten-sided dice with the numbers from 1 to 10).  You can type any
of the following, to roll 7 dice:
> `/ore 7d10`

> `/ore 7d`

> `/ore 7`

> `/ore 7d #electric dash attack!`

They will all result in the same thing - a chat message that includes the result of the roll, with dice grouped up to
sets.

Any text written after the `#`, "flavor text", will also be included.

You can also use them as inline roll buttons in text, that can be clicked.  For example:
> `[[/ore 7d #electric dash attack!]]`

### Sets

The dice shown on the left are the "sets" you rolled.  Sets include two or more dice with the same value.  A set's 
"height" is that value, while a set's "width" is the amount of dice.  For example, rolling a pair of tens is a "2x10",
which has width 2 and height 10.

Visually, the dice in the sets will be shown in a column of identical-value dice.

Sets can be clicked to select/outline them (visible only to you).

### Loose Dice

The dice shown on the right - which are smaller and uncolored - are the "loose dice".

Loose dice can be clicked to select/outline them (visible only to you).

Loose dice can be alt-clicked to
make them go down, by 1 each time, until it goes below 1 and returns to its original value.

### Expert/Hard Dice

Expert/hard dice can be added using the syntax /ore Xd XeX.

The 'e' can be replaced with 'E', 'h', or 'H'. If you don't put in the first number (e.g. `/ore 5d e1`) then the number of dice will default to 1. If you don't put in the second number (e.g. /ore 5d 1e), then the dice will default to 10.

The expert/hard dice will be added to the normal roll, becoming part of sets or loose dice as normal.
